# Rubocop: The Future of Standards Enforcement

__Skill Level:__ Beginner - Intermediate
__Time Limit:__ 45 minutes 

This is a challenge for learning Rubocop and how to do things the 'ruby' way.
You will also learn about refactoring and why it's important.

## Instructions
You have been tasked to clean up Gem City. Luckily your boss has paired you up with the newest advancement in code enforcement, Rubocop.  
1. Install the required gems
```gem install bundler
bundle install```
2. Run rspec with ```rspec gem_city_spec.rb``` and then get a feel for the code that's passing.
3. Run rubocop with ```rubocop``` or ```rubocop <filename>``` and see what's failing.
4. Correct all rubocop errors.
5. Rerun the tests and rubocop. If there are no complaints, congratulations you've cleaned up the streets of Gem City. There are 3 lines in the rspec file that you can change, leave the rest.

Bonus: Write the city demographics feature
- Uncomment the block of code at the end of the spec file
- Write the code to make the test pass.
- Run rubocop and then make the corrections.
- Rerun your test. If it passes, you've successfully refactored your function.

Challenge: See how short you can make the GemCity class while still passing Rubocop and rspec tests

__NOTE:__ Important steps or reminders should be noticeable.  

## Things to think about
- Why would you want to follow standards?
- What is the purpose of refactoring, if it works, why refactor?
- How can refactoring help us expand our code?
- The bonus follows a process called Red, Green, Refactor.
